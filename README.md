# Webpage_Saliency_Prediction

In this project, we have done a focused study on the saliencyanalysis for webpages using FiWi dataset [21] and propose a FullyConvolutional Network (FCN) [18] based architecture to predictthe saliency of webpages. Given an input Webpage image, the pro-posed model is capable of generating its saliency map. Rigoroussimulations and performance evaluation of the model justifies thatFCN-based architecture performs with Correlation score 0.60 andNSS score 0.985, which are competitive to other state-of-the-artsaliency models
