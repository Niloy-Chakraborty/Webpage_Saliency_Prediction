# Webpage_Saliency_Prediction

In this project, we have done a focused study on the saliency analysis for webpages using FiWi dataset and propose a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) based architecture to predictthe saliency of webpages. Given an input Webpage image, the proposed model is capable of generating its saliency map.


P.S. This whole project has been tested on Google Colab.
